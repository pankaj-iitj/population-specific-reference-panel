# GenomeIndia-LD
The Genome India project aims to catalogue genetic variations within India's diverse population comprehensively. Its main goal is to build a comprehensive genomic database that not only sheds light on disease genetic underpinnings but also unravels the unique fabric of India's population genetics, migratory patterns, and ancestral roots. In this report, we go into the crucial computational and data analysis stages that are critical to the part of the project. We concentrate on measuring linkage disequilibrium using pre-prepared Variant Calling Format (VCF) files given by our collaborators. The report provides an overview of the computational approaches used to analyse linkage disequilibrium by constructing a custom reference panel from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data. Furthermore, we provide a concise summary of the expected results, code snippets and expected timeline for completion of the objectives.
