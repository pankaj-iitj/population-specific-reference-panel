# Comprehensive pipeline for creating LD-based reference panel
![Pipeline_workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8143c56-f936-4ceb-8f7f-c67a80478613)

We present a comprehensive pipeline to creating Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)-based reference panel from whole genome sequencing (WGS) paired-end reads. The pipeline expects whole genome paired-end reads (R1/R2) in 'fastq' (or, fastq.gz) and the final output will be an LD-based reference panel in HDF5 format.
